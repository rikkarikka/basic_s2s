dirty jokes funny movies seeing someone die	that is a funny thing i heard in my life i never saw in your face <eos>	get her fingers caught in a car door
maybe all this waiting for one true love stuff gets you nowhere	i know you 'r e a liar but my son is dead <eos>	i thought we 'd better make absolutely sure we weren 't late
i used to have someone i loved	i 'm not sure i understand what you 'r e thinking <eos>	i feel funny seeing the two of you together
you can 't fool me !	i am a human being and he loves me and i am a human being or i don 't love her <eos>	don 't forget i 'm your master !
i finally felt safe again and the cops show up at my job	but you were just a little kid and you were just like the rest of the people i was and <eos>	what drugs do you have access to ?
i think they 'r e just about to figure us out	i think i know where the guy was and that he was here <eos>	you 'r e sure he 's a demon right ?
i know what i saw	what i saw and i saw that man <eos>	i want to check something out
i got enough on me with your bastard cousin	and i got to do something about my job i don 't care what i think of him <eos>	but leave me out of it !
i take back all the rotten things i ever said about the lab boys	there was a time i i i i i i i was just a boy and i just <eos>	great is the tape rolling ?
i have my black dress !	i 'm sorry to disturb your movie <eos>	don 't let everyone see us for what we are !
she broke my heart a thousand ways	but my love is a thousand years she loves you <eos>	comin on through step aside !
there is gonna be more isn 't there ?	you 'r e not a woman <eos>	how can i be happy when you 'r e not happy ?
that 's why you 'r e helping me	i know that you are a man and i love you <eos>	look i 'm sorry you lost all your stuff but it was not me who stole it
it may have escaped your notice but l 'm a grown woman	l m not sure i know where my daughter was here <eos>	and i didn 't listen then
if you give me a good reason	i want to know what you 'r e thinking and what you 'r e doing is wrong <eos>	if you want to be a cop your only choice is to work for me
